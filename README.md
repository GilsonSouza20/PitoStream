# PitoStream

PitoStream is a Java-based backend project designed to request movie information from an API based on user input.

While it's a straightforward endeavor on its own, when integrated with a front-end, it can serve as an impressive addition to your portfolio, mimicking popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and more.

Currently, the project handles basic movie searches, but there is ample room for enhancements such as implementing user-specific favorite movie lists and a future watchlist feature.
